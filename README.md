# Burger
Eat the burger!

# Node Express Handlebars

## Description

This is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). You can type in a burger, add it, and then devour it.  

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* My app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Tech/Framework

* VS code

* Dbeaver

* MySQL

* Express

* Express-handlebars
